# Capstone-Project-Regression

Background:
Household energy consumption is a crucial factor in understanding and optimizing energy usage. Accurate prediction of appliance energy consumption is essential for improving energy efficiency and reducing costs for homeowners.

Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to develop a reliable regression model that accurately predicts household appliance energy consumption based on various environmental and internal factors. By analyzing a dataset that includes information such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and other relevant parameters, the model should be able to forecast the energy consumed by appliances within a household accurately.

Objective:
The primary objective is to create a predictive model that can estimate the energy consumption of appliances within a household based on the given set of environmental and internal parameters. The model should provide a robust framework for homeowners to better manage their energy usage and make informed decisions to improve energy efficiency.

Deliverables:

1. A well-documented regression model that accurately predicts appliance energy consumption.
2. An analysis of the most influential factors affecting energy consumption within a household.
3. Recommendations for optimizing energy usage based on the model's insights.

Success Criteria:
The success of the project will be evaluated based on the model's accuracy in predicting appliance energy consumption. Additionally, the project's success will be determined by the identification of key factors that significantly impact energy usage and the provision of actionable insights for homeowners to reduce energy consumption effectively.
